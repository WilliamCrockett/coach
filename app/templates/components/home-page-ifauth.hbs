<div class="welcome-div col-md-6">
  <h3>You're in!</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Check out the instructions below:</h4>
  <p>
    The main features are being able to add a {{#link-to "newSession"}}new session{{/link-to}},
    view all exisiting {{#link-to "sessions"}}sessions{{/link-to}} and edit these sessions, if
    they were created by you!

    If you didn't create the session, you'll only have view access, and wont be able to delete or
    edit this.

    <hr>

    This should also be styled better... (sorry...)
